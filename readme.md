Game Title
Leaping Frog

Game Objective
The game objective of Leaping Frog is to reach to the top of a magical well without falling down to the lower levels, during its journey the Leaping Frog will encounter many obstacles that will prevent him from reaching to the top of the magical well, here the game objective of the player is to guide the Leaping Frog to the top of the well.

Failure Condition
Falling down to a lower level. The character will take damage after falling down, with the damage scaling with the quantity of screens he fell down. 

Game Structure
The game space is a magical well, subdivided into around 20 screens, each having one platforming challenge with the objective of getting higher up. If you fail the challenge, you may end up going several screens down and losing health in the process, having to repeat the challenges again and obtain health packs to prevent the frog from starting from the bottom of the well, we expect you, the players, to keep challenging the platforming challenge until you can complete them all in a row.

Inspiration
The game concept takes most of its inspiration from Jump King, a platformer which emphasizes being frustrating and difficult. The idea is to perform a series of increasingly difficult platforming challenges to reach the top, with failure resulting in you dropping several levels and having to redo all of them.

OOP Implementation
We plan to implement a class system for the platforms and walls of the game, that way we can easily determine if they are floors, floating platforms, slanted platforms, moving platforms, etc. This will also allow us to change their physics more easily, such as the traction of a grass platform as opposed to an ice platform. We also plan to implement a series of modifications for the character in each level, for example, an ice level where the character itself has low traction, or a level where he bounces higher than normal, forcing the player to adapt. 

Example

In this example, the character must reach the top by jumping across the three platforms, and while they are on the top one they move on to the next screen.
